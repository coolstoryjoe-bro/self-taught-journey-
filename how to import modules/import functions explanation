To import functions you need to create a module.
A module is a file ending in '.py' that contains the code you want to import into your program.

You're able to have a .py file with a bunch of functions and the 'import' command will /
import the entire .py file with all the functions.
    To separate the all the functions in the .py file, all you need to do is:
        module_name.function_name()
        from module_name import function_name
        from module_name import function_1, function_2, function_3,


    irl example:
        pizza.make_pizza()

        from pizza import make_pizza
        pizza.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
        pizza.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
