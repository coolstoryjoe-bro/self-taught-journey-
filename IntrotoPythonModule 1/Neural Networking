What is a Neural Network?

- A network of interconnected nodes, each with "weights" and "biases" and data flows through it from input to output.
- Neural networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns.
- The name is derived from their structure, modelled around the human brain.
- Several layers, each containing operations to process inputs, or map pathways through the network to produce outputs.
- We'll focus mostly on the network layers ("dense" or "connected") and take a look at operations in the next section.

- These layers consists of mini networks of many interconnected nodes, each with assigned "weights" and a "biases".
- Weights are assigned an initial value assigned and are altered according to an activation function during training.
- Biases are just some constant value assigned to each node.
- The weight of each connection determines with path to take once a node receives an input, repeated until the end.
- The output of one layer (or pathway) may be in the input to the next layer or map to one of the final end nodes.
- What this means for us is that the image data runs through the network util patterns are recognized.
- We get similar images consistently mapping to the final output node, even if the middle of the pathway is different.
- For Example, if out model tried to recognize whether or not an image contains a face, each image with a face will,
    after training, take similar albeit not identical0 pathways through the network.
    Images without faces will take different pathway that ultimately map to different output neurons.
- Image classification is all about recognizing patterns consistent ot all images of a category.
- Our models learn the pathways and adjust neuron weights during training to build said pathway.
