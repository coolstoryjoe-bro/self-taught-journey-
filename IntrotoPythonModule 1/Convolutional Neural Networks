What are convolutional neural networks?

In short, just a neural network that performs a series of convolutions and maz pooling before dense layers.
Our model will have convolutional, max pooling, several formatting, then dense and dropout layers.
We will explore first how the image data is represented and then go into convolution and max pooling functions.

Image Data:
Our images will all be of a fixed size and often have 3 colour channels involved (Red, Green, and Blue).
Each of the pixels in an image will have some value between 0 and 255 for each colour channel.
Each pixel is considered a feature and should be analyzed to accurately classify the image to a label.
This is a problem as even a small image of 32 x 32 has 1024 features and not every pixel is super important.

Convolutions:
A convolution essentially takes a matrix of a pixel values and applies a filter (called a kernel) of a fixed size to
    each n x n block of the matrix.
Example, if our kernel is 5 x 5, it will be applied ot each 5 x 5 block of the image and output the results of the
    operation between the filter and the image sub-matrix to output some new, smaller set features.
This reduces "noise" or parts of the image that are unnecessary adn focuses only on the important parts of the image.
Generally, the next step here is to apply a max-pooling layer.

Max-pooling:
We are taking the matrix of features outputted by the convolution and taking the max value for each n x n sub-matrix.
So let's say that we are max-pooling with a 2 x 2 kernel.
This will find the maximum value in each 2 x 2 block of the input matrix and output that to a matrix of features.
This greatly reduces the size of the matrix that we input to the dense layers and helps accentuate important
    features in the image while ignoring extraneous data.
