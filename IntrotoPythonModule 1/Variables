# Variables
# Variables types and Python Syntax

# ints, floats, booleans, strings
    #Int: they represent whole numbers. Can be + or -. Once turned into a decimal, becomes a float.
    #Floats: Are decimal numbers, can be a whole number.
    #Booleans: True or False values
    #Strings: Anything that is in between the "" or the ''. Ex: of strings are text, messages, names, stuff like that.

# Basic variable Syntax
    #name = value

# Hulk Exercise:
    #Example of Int:
        age = 32
    #Example of Float:
        rage_factor = 0.5
    #Example of Boolean:
        is_in_hulk_form = false
    #Example of string:
        name = "Bruce Banner"

#Practice.py Practice:
    age = 49
    rage_factor = 0.5
    is_in_hulk_form = False
    name = "Bruce Banner"
    print(age, rage_factor,is_in_hulk_form,name)

    print(type(age))
    print(type(rage_factor))
    print(type(is_in_hulk_form))
    print(type(name))

# Variable operators and operations
# Type Conversion
    #Assignment Operators:
        This is the equal (=) or (not) operator
    #Arithmetic Operators:
        + , - , * , / , % , // ,+= , -= , *= , /=
        "%" is divide with remainder
        "//" is divide without remainder
    #Conditional Operators:
        > , >= , < , <= , == , != , is
        == is testing if both values are equal
        != is testing if both are not equal
        % divides providing the remainder
        // divides leaving out the remainder

#Practice.py Practice:
age = 49
rage_factor = 0.5
is_in_hulk_form = False
name = "Bruce Banner"
print(age, rage_factor,is_in_hulk_form,name)


#Assignment Operators
is_not_in_hulk_form = not is_in_hulk_form
print(is_not_in_hulk_form)
new_age = age + 1
print(new_age)

full_name = name + " - the hulk"
print(full_name)

#Arithmetic Operators
print(50 % 7)
print(50 // 7)

age += 1
print(age)

#Conditional Operators
print(5 > 2)
print(5 < 2)
print(5 == 2)
print(5 != 2)

age = bool(age)
