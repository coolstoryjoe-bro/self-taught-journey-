# Collections
# Convenient ways to store multiple values in a single location. IE: A list of names or numbers.
# Can also get attributes from lists.


# Tuples ()
# Example: Name = (val1, val2)
# An index is a name or value within the parenthesis such as "Thor". The indexes always start with 0 and "Thor" is index 0 while "Hulk" is index 1.

print(first_three_names)
print(first_three_names[0])
print(len(first_three_names))
# first_three_names[0] = "" # not allowed.


# Lists and List Operations []
# Lists will allow us to add or remove elements to and from a list. We can delete elements and insert elements and so forth.

# In the sense of a dictionary, the word would be the key, and the definition would be the value.
# The first word is a "word" or "key", while the word after the colon is the "definition" or "value".
