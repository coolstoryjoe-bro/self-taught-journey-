What is Machine Learning?

- Machine learning described a machine's (computer program's) ability to learn and improve from experience.
- If a program yields a net improvement in its results without being explicitly programmed, it is said to have learned.
- Programs will get better at performing their task with increased exposure to relevant data and further training.
- We use machine learning in optimization, prediction, and classification scenarios.
- Examples: Such as Stock Market prediction, or image recognition.
- There are many machine learning algorithms that we can use, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. **Research This**
- We will be using a convolutional neural network for image classification trained under supervised learning.

There are 4 main steps to building a machine learning model: processing data, building a model, training the model, /
    and testing the model.

-Processing data: this is where we gather and format enough data to train a model.
    The more relevant data the model has been fed, the more accurate it can be.
    We first gather a lot of relevant data that is useful for the training model.
    We then process the data so that it is all of the same format and can be easily interpreted by the model.
    Generally, we divide the total amount of data into training and testing sets and label the data.
- Building a model: This is where we actually write the algorithms to help us solve our problem.
    We first have to decide which type of model works best for out situation.
    Then, we implement the model by constructing a computational graph.
    This graph will contain all of the operation used to process the input and produce a useful output.
    It is a network of interconnected nodes that hold values or operations and maps pathways from inputs to outputs.
    THe graph is where all of the calculation happens that produces the results (hopefully) that we want.
- Training the model: This is where the model becomes more accurate by modifying values within the graph.
    We run the training data through our model and compare the model's outputs to the expected results.
    The total difference between the expected answer and the model output is called the loss.
    Generally we try to minimise this as it means we are getting closer to the correct answer.
    We use optimization functions to alter values within the graph as the model trains to minimize loss.
    Supervised learning is where we teach the model which outputs map to certain inputs.
    The model changes it values to try to match the input-output mapping that we established.
    If we are happy with the results, we continue to testing phase.
    If not, we adjust parameters within the model or fetch more data and continue the training process.
-Testing the model: Once we are happy with out results form training we run the model on the test data set.
    We then measure how well out model performs on data that it has never seen before.
    If we are happy with the results (loss, accuracy, etx.) then we have a completed model!
    We of course hav eot convert out outputs into something meaningful to us.
    For example with image classification, we want ot map the outputs to labels that categorize each input image.
