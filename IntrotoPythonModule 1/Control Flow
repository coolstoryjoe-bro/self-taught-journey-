# Control Flow
# Allows us perform various tests that return a true or false value and then we get to --->
# execute certain blocks of code based on the result.
# This means that if a result returns True, we execute code block A, --->
# if the result returns false, we execute code block B.

# If Statements
# Example: if condition == true: execute code block here
# if, else, elif, and/or, not

# While and for-in loops
# A loop gives us a mechanism by which we can execute a statement or block of statements many many times even
# if we write it only once.
# "While" is the code I use for implement the loop.
# "Break" and "Continue" statements are there to stop a possible infinite loop.
# "Continue" skips over a loop code and continues onto the next code.
# "Break" breaks the loops and adds a contingency cap for your loop.
#For-In loops is the variable that is in between "for" and "in" will be considered the variable for the list of
# variables after "in".
