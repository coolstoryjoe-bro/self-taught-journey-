    <h1>Specifying the width</h1>
    <p>
        This paragraph has normal behavior of a block-level element. It takes up the entire width of the page, 
        and the next element is placed underneath.
    </p>
    <p class="floated">
        Paragraph 2
        This paragraph is floated left. The next element will be placed to the right of it.
        Now this has a width of 50%
    </p>
    <p class="right">
        Paragraph 3
        This paragraph now has a margin-left so it is separated from the previous paragraph. 
        Its width is still automatically determined.
    </p>
