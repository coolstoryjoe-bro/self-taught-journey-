        Paragraph 1
        This paragraph has the normal behavior of a block-level element.
        It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next elementis placed underneath.
    </p>
    <p class="floated">
        Paragraph 2
        This paragraph is floated left. It is placed to the left, and the next element will be placed
        to the right of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paragraph 3
        This paragraph has not floating, width or margin. It takes whatever space it can to the right
        of the floated element, and then flows to the next line. 
    </p>
